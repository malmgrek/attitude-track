# Attitude tracking

Mobile phones contain many interesting sensors that can be useful tools when developing e.g. sensor fusion algorithms. This project contains an example implementation of a pipeline consisting of

- Data receiving from mobile phone,
- Sensor fusion algorithm for estimating sensor orientation,
- Real-time visualization on PC.

The attitude tracking in based on a quaternion-free method for estimating gravitation direction in sensor's coordinates. Visualization using OpenGL and Pygame.
